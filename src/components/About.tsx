                    I&apos;m a software engineer who loves turning complex problems into clean, functional code. After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, I joined an international team where I currently develop modern web and mobile applications using TypeScript and Python.
                </span>
                <span>
                    Right now, I&apos;m spending my time exploring the intersection of software development and AI/ML, looking for new ways to integrate intelligence into the apps I build.
